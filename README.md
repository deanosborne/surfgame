# Proceed

Proceed is a first person movement game based on the mechanics of 'surfing' and 'bunnyhopping'. It was developed in an effort to emulate Source Engine movement in Unity to create movement options such as bhopping and surfing (acceleration and storage of velocity).

Proceed contains 3 levels, 2 built (Tutorial and secret) aswell as one exported CS:GO custom map for surfing.
